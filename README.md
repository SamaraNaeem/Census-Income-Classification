# Census Income Classification

This project predicts whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K using demographic and employment-related features from the UCI Census Income dataset.

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning classification models that can accurately predict income category (>50K or ≤50K).

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Adult / Census Income dataset)
- Records include age, education, occupation, workclass, marital status, race, sex, hours-per-week, and capital gain/loss.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The best-performing model achieved strong predictive performance in distinguishing income groups, demonstrating the effectiveness of feature engineering and model selection.
